    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img class="aboutMePicture" src="Images/porscheBalcony.JPG" alt="porsche in london">

    <h3>I'm Porsche, a Web Developer based out of Toronto, Canada.</h3>

    <p>These days my time is spent researching, designing, and coding new projects.</p>

    <p>I occasionally take on freelance opportunities.</p>

    <p>Have an exciting project where you need some help? Let's connect!</p>
    
    <p>Out of the office, you'll find me cooking & baking, reading books, playing my Nintendo Switch, binge watching older TV shows, riding dirt bikes, and attending yoga and spin classes!</p>

    <p>I also enjoy my morning coffee(s), watering my houseplants, petting dogs.</p>
